## 💡 Key Educational Concepts

### The 4% Withdrawal Rule
For every **$40,000/year** you want in retirement income, you need about **$1,000,000** in savings.

### The Power of Starting Early  
Starting retirement savings at 25 vs 35 can mean the difference between saving $300/month vs $800/month for the same retirement outcome.

### Inflation is a Silent Wealth Killer
At 2.5% inflation, prices double every 28 years. $50,000 today will cost $100,000 in 28 years.

### Compound Interest is Your Best Friend
Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." These examples show why.
