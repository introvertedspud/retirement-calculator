# Retirement Calculator

Welcome to the Retirement Calculator â€“ your go-to tool for comprehensive retirement planning!

## Introduction

Are you ready to embark on the journey of securing your financial future? Planning for retirement can be both exciting and challenging. As someone with a deep passion for personal finance and a desire for a brighter financial future, I've created this tool to help you navigate the complexities of retirement planning.

## Why I Created This Package

My journey into retirement planning began with a simple realization: existing tools didn't provide me with the insights I needed. I wanted to know not only how much I should save for retirement but also how to get there. I realized that:

- I couldn't find a tool that told me exactly how much I should contribute each month to reach my desired retirement balance.
- Even if I reached my goal, I had no idea how much I could safely spend in retirement.
- Inflation would significantly impact my retirement needs, yet most calculators ignored this crucial factor.

To address these challenges, I started developing the Retirement Calculator package. It's a work in progress, and I have more exciting features in mind, but it's already a powerful tool for your retirement planning needs.

## Key Features
- **Contribution Calculation**: Determine monthly contributions to reach a specific retirement balance.
- **Withdrawal Estimation**: Find out how much you can spend from your retirement savings.
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Consider the impact of inflation on your retirement planning.

## Usage

### Calculating Monthly Contributions
```typescript
const calculator = new RetirementCalculator();
const contributionDetails = calculator.getContributionNeededForDesiredBalance(
  startingBalance,
  desiredBalance,
  years,
  annualInterestRate,
  contributionFrequency,
  compoundingFrequency,
  inflationRate
);
```

### Calculating Compound Interest with Contributions
```typescript
const compoundInterest = calculator.getCompoundInterestWithAdditionalContributions(
initialBalance,
monthlyContribution,
years,
annualInterestRate,
contributionFrequency,
compoundingFrequency
);
```
## Planned Enhancements
- **Detailed Periodic Reporting**: Provide a detailed breakdown of investments and interest accrued over each period, ideal for visualization.
- **Fee Management**: Include functionality to account for management fees and their long-term impact.
- **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Adapt to changing interest rates to reflect different stages of financial planning.
- **Loan and Withdrawal Impact**: Assess the effect of loans or withdrawals on your retirement savings.

## Upcoming Integration
- **Interactive UI**: Developing an intuitive interface for easy retirement planning.
- **Budgeting Tool Integration**: A future project to integrate with a budgeting tool for a comprehensive financial planning solution.
